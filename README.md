## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I have to name my resume file as index.md?**  
A: Yes, because GitHub won't be able to load your resume onto the website otherwise.

**Q: Can I use other text editors besides Atom?**  
A: Yes, you can use any text editor of your preference. But for the purpose of this guide, I think Atom is the most appropriate as it is linked to GitHub and also allows you to preview your work in real time

**Q: Why can't I see my changes on the website?**  
A: If you have correctly followed all the steps in the instructions above, then it is most likely a problem on GitHub's side. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do besides waiting for the change to eventually come. If you have waited for a long time with no progress, I recommend deleting your repository and create a new one to see if the problem persists.
